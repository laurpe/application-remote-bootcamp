    <h1>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1>
    <p>Search engine optimization is a way of directing traffic to your website from search engines.
      Its aim is to get your website on top of a search engine’s results when the searched keywords
      match the content of your site. Search engines have complex algorithms that are used to rank
      sites for a specific query. The most important factor on getting a site to show on a search
      engine is having high quality content, but the site’s metadata (titles, image and meta descriptions,
      link texts, urls) also matter. A site’s rank also depends on how reliable the site is (security and
      speed of the connection, links to the site from reliable sites).</p>
